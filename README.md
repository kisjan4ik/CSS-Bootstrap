# Responsive Portfolio

## Description 


The main purpose of this project is to learn how to correctly use the Bootstrap elements and to correct them according to your requirements. Also, in the project I structured the page using layout element and making the grid system: 's', 's', 's'. The media queries that are already included in the Bootstrap CSS help to make the page correctly displayed on the different types of devices with the different screen sizes.

The project contains 3 pages of .html: index.html (the main page), portfolio.html and contact.html.
On the main page I placed the navbar with responsive brand and collapsing menu. I used one container for brand for it to be responsive with the other container on the page that consists of 3 rows which are the main row with the picture and the information about me, the row, dividing the main row and the footer and the row for the footer. The dividing row between the page content and the footer and the row for the footer I used for all three pages.

Th index.html container with the content contains 'Col-sm-9' for it to cover 3/4 of the page width. The picture is floating left which gives possibility for the text to be on the side and on the bottom of it.
For the portfolio.html I used the same page layout but the column-9 in the main container is divided for another 3 sub rows with 2 columns-6 each. This gives me the possibility to place 6 pictures identical size of 170*245px. All these pictures are covered with responsive text-blocks that are linked to the project locations. To reach this I made the picture position relative and text-blocks position absolute.

The contact.html has the same page layout as the other two pages and has 'Col-sm-9' with the Form and three input groups for the Name, Email address and Message and the Submit button.
The pages are linked to each other using nav-links in the navbar.




## Installation

In order for the webpages to work and respond correctly I linked Bootstrap stylesheet in the head of each html document and also the collapsed menu on the navbar requires the use of JavaScript and I placed the 'script' from Bootstrap right before the closing ' tag on each page as well.

## Usage 

This project is good to use as a portfolio template that can be developed and completed with information and effects in future.
