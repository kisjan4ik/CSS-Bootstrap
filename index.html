                    <p> It was always easy for me to learn and that is why I almost never had to work hard while
                        learning new stuff.
                        I started to work for a big company when I still was studying in an University. Back then I
                        lived in Ukraine and my position in the copmany was a translator of technical documentation,
                        mostly I translated documents from Russian into English.
                    </p>
                    <p> Then I decided to find a job that would be closer to my major and that's why I worked for a
                        while in a bank.
                        I was thinking not once in my life that programming is an interesting thing to do but always
                        thought one shoud have a specifically "built" brain to do it. And that was the reason I had
                        never tried learning to code.
                    </p>
                    <p> But I've moved to USA a couple of years ago and have decided that it was already a big change in
                        my life and what is the reason not to try to make another one. This is how I found the UCF
                        Bootcamp. </p>
                    <p> I can say now that this is exciting and hard at the same time. It is one of those rare times I
                        really need to work hard to learn and understand the stuff. But I really enjoy that I can
                        actually see what I have built and that gives me an inspiration I've never had before, because
                        all my previous jobs did not have an option for me to actually see the result of my work.
                        <br>
                        I have big expectaions about what I will know and what I will be able to do after this Bootcamp
                        and I will do my best in learning!
